# World_Weather_Analysis
PlanMyTrip is a top travel technology company that specializes in internet related services in the hotel and lodging industry who had an employee collect weather data across cities worldwide and perform analysis so that the application can provide visual recommendations of ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.

## Overview of Project:
As part of Beta testing, PlanMyTrip got recommendations and some of which the company wants to incorporate.
Below is the list of recommendations that the company wants implemented.
1. Add the weather description to the weather data,
2. filter using the input provided by the beta testers on the weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and list them out for the beta user,
3. the beta user will choose four cities based on which a travel itinerary needs to be created, and,
4. finally, create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map using the Google Maps Direction API.

## Implementation:
This new assignment consists of three technical analyses. 

Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
### Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
The collection code was updated to bring in Weather Description (for example, clouds, fog, light rain, clear sky) along with Latitude, Longitude, Maximum Temperature, Percent Humidity, Percent Cloudiness and Wind Speed for the cities. Refer [Weather Data Collection Code](Weather_Database/Weather_Database.ipynb) for the code and [Weather Data Output](Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.csv) for the output data file.


### Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Get user input for Weather preferences to filter and identify and list the potential travel destinations based on the user preferences:
